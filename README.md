# World Bank Health Expenditure Analysis

## 📌 What is this project about?

This project analyzes the relationship between public health expenditure and key health outcomes using open data from the World Bank.

Specifically, it explores whether higher health spending per capita is associated with improvements in:

- Life expectancy at birth  
- Infant mortality rate  

The analysis integrates multiple macroeconomic indicators to evaluate how public investment in healthcare correlates with measurable population health outcomes across countries and over time.

## 🎯 What question does it aim to answer?

> Does higher public health expenditure lead to better national health outcomes?

Additionally:

- Is the relationship consistent across countries?
- Does economic context (e.g., GDP per capita) influence this relationship?
- Are some countries more “efficient” in converting health spending into health improvements?

## 🧠 Why does this matter?

Understanding the relationship between government health spending and public health outcomes helps:

- Evaluate the effectiveness of public policy
- Compare health system performance globally
- Identify patterns in healthcare investment efficiency
- Support data-driven decision-making in public economics
